# Problem Statement: Courier Overload in Nairobi

## Context
HALISI is a delivery service operating in Nairobi, Kenya. Couriers are constantly present in the city with pre-packed backpacks (the main product being dietary supplements), so **they do not need to return to a warehouse or hub to pick up orders**.

As soon as a new order is received, the courier gets a notification and **proceeds directly to the customer from their current location**.

## Problem
- During peak hours (12:00–14:00 and 17:00–20:00), there is a high workload — not enough active couriers.
- During off-peak hours, couriers remain idle without orders.
- This leads to:
  - delays in delivery;
  - inefficiency (low courier utilization rate);
  - increased costs;
  - decreased customer satisfaction.

## Causes
- Couriers are unevenly distributed across the city;
- Lack of flexible shifts and dynamic reallocation;
- Demand varies depending on area, weather, and time of day — but this is not factored into planning.

## Project Goal
- Analyze the geographic distribution of couriers at the time orders are received;
- Identify areas with oversupply or undersupply of couriers;
- Propose changes to zones and schedules;
- Build a prototype interface - a "courier load heatmap" for dispatchers.
